Entry Lottoree allows you to display random entries from your 
exp:channel:entries loop.

For example, let's say you want to display a single random entry 
from your 5 most recent blog articles. Using Entry Lottoree you 
can do this by adding the 'lottoree' parameter to your 
exp:channel:entries loop, like this:

{exp:channel:entries channel="blog" limit="5" lottoree="1"}
  {title}
{/exp:channel:entries}

This would select a single random article from your five most 
recent blog entries. 

Want to select two random articles from your five most recent 
blog entries? Do this:

{exp:channel:entries channel="blog" limit="5" lottoree="2"}
  {title}
{/exp:channel:entries}

You can use any of the standard exp:channel:entries parameters 
to filter the 'pool' from which the lucky entry is pulled from. 
For example, if you want to display a random article from your 
Top 5 Most Commented Blog Articles, you could do this:

{exp:channel:entries channel="blog" limit="5" orderby="comment_total" lottoree="1"}
  {title}
{/exp:channel:entries}
